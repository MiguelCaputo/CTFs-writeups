# Decoding 6 (Hard)

## Flavor Text

We have intercepted encrypted messages between hackers. Along with the messages were the numbers "3" and "6". Decipher them and find out what they are doing.

## Cipher 1

>m e v c si haaesr ocnettebtonrno nocs spkutorhiiamtaa

## Solution

After looking everywhere I found this website

 [https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking)
 
 And tried a bunch of ciphers until I found Rail fence, with Rails=3 and Offset=6 we can find a similar message but it was not completely right

So i had to look for another cipher, and I found https://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher

Using rows=3, and keep puntuation, start from bottom, and using offset=6

> make sure to convert the bitcoin ransom into cash asap

## Cipher 2

> ttmewhae onroier enisln hohem sghsntr i a os

## Solution 

Same as before but with options height=6, From top and no offset

> the hashrate on the monero miners is slowing
